Beginning my intro to the C# Programming Languange
The projects directory flow is broken up in three parts, challenges, lectures, and independent challenges. Although the descriptions are pretty stragiht forward, here are some details about each directory. The lecture director will hold all exercises, and detailed comments of information provided in each lesson. Sub Directories will be categorized by section, and those directories will hold the content held throughout. This ensures that I am gettting an autentic understnding of what is being discussed in the course. The "challenges" directory will hold all challenges that are given to me via the course. I will be solving the challenge myself, and will provide the instructors solutions below my initial approach. I decided to create a new directory with the title of independent challenges, these are topics that I wanted to get a better understanding and practice with. The goal of this directory is to complete/create a program on my own with minimal and hopefully no assistance. In the case where I do in fact get stuck, I will make sure to add a comment on the section of the code along with the lecture subdirectory I used for resource. Thank you for visiting.
